Solution:

WITH city_length AS (
        SELECT city, LENGTH(city) length_city, 
            rank() OVER(ORDER BY LENGTH(city), city) AS shortest_city,
            rank() OVER(ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city) AS longest_city
        FROM station
                )
SELECT city, length_city
FROM city_length
WHERE shortest_city = 1
UNION
SELECT city, length_city
FROM city_length
WHERE longest_city = 1;
